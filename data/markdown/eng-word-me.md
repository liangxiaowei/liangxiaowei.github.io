-  This experience entitled `me` to be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends —— walden

-  Wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radiated from `me` accordingly —— walden

- My imagination carried `me` so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave `me` a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered `me` ten dollars to release him —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to `me`, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to `me`; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between `me` and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please `me` the more at last —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding `me` of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  With this more substantial shelter about `me`, I had made some progress toward settling in the world —— walden

-  This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of crystallization around `me`, and reacted on the builder —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed `me` like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded `me` —— walden

-  "Excuse me," a voice said, "aren't you Wilson?1' He looked up at a middle-aged man in the inevitable khaki shorts with a drawn face the colour of hay —— the heart of the matter

-  "Yes, that's me —— the heart of the matter

- "That's me —— the heart of the matter

-  "You remember me, Mr —— the heart of the matter

-  If you would step with me for a moment into the bathroom  —— the heart of the matter

-  But when I do get home you'll never see me here again —— the heart of the matter
