- `garden` S1 W1 [ˈgɑ:rdn]



- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a `garden`﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the `garden` and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden
