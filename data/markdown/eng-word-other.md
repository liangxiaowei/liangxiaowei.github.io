-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no `other` motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many `other`s —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of `other` lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each `other` suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  But in `other` directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden
