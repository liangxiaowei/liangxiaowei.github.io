-  In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, `for` all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word `for` his deed, `for` I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  I discovered many a site `for` a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, `for` a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, `for` I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm `for` just what I gave `for` it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials `for` a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it `for` many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received `for` that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay `for` it and be unmolested in my possession of it; `for` I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  But I would say to my fellows, once `for` all, As long as possible live free and uncommitted —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden
