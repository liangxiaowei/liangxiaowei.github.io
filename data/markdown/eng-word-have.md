- `have` S1 W3 [hæv]



-  I `have` thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live —— walden

-  In imagination I `have` bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I `had` enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might `have` thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their houses, may be sure that they `have` been anticipated —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even `had` the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and `had` begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man `has` such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I `had` but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who `had` ten cents, or who `had` a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I `had` carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still `had` my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  I found thus that I `had` been a rich man without any damage to my poverty —— walden

-  But I retained the landscape, and I `have` since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow —— walden

- I `have` frequently seen a poet withdraw, `having` enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he `had` got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet `has` put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, `has` fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should `have`; but above all, the recollection I `had` of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  I was in `has`te to buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which `had` sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, `had` made any more of his improvements —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which `had` no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  But it turned out as I `have` said —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I `have` always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I `had` `had` my seeds ready —— walden

-  I `have` no doubt that time discriminates between the good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I `have` seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  As I `have` said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I `had` visited a year before —— walden

- The only house I `had` been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, `has` gone down the stream of time —— walden

-  With this more substantial shelter about me, I `had` made some progress toward settling in the world —— walden

-  I did not need to go outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within `had` lost none of its freshness —— walden

- ” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by `having` imprisoned one, but `having` caged myself near them —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon `had` all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood `had` been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  It is well to `have` some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth —— walden

-  Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea —— the heart of the matter

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter

-  He was like the lagging finger of the barometer, still pointing to Fair long after its companion had moved to Stormy —— the heart of the matter

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter
