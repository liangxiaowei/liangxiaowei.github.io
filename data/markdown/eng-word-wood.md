- `wood` S2 W2 [wʊd]



- When first I took up my abode in the `wood`s, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the `wood` thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive `wood` between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the `wood`s that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with `wood`, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the `wood`s, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the `wood` thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the `wood` had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a `wood`ed valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the `wood`s which surrounded me —— walden
