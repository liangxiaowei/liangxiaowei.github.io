-  This experience entitled me to be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker `by` my friends —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned `by` actual possession —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway `by` a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it `by` its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed `by` rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, `by` accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that `by` noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

- ” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not `by` having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them —— walden

- I was seated `by` the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, `by` degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened `by` clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden

-  From a hilltop near `by`, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  Indeed, `by` standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps `by` a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even `by` this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden

-  They were surrounded immediately by small boys wearing school caps —— the heart of the matter

-  Scobie stopped and had a word with a black man in a white panama: a black policeman passed by, saluting smartly, Scobie went on —— the heart of the matter

-  You know the kind of thing — poems on exile by aircraftsmen, water-colours by stokers, poker-work from the mission schools —— the heart of the matter
