- `it` S1 W1 [ɪt]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging `it` to him in my mind; even put a higher price on `it`﻿—took everything but a deed of `it`﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated `it`, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed `it` long enough, leaving him to carry `it` on —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from `it` —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let `it` lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry `it` on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of `it`, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep `it`, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and `it` surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried `it` far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for `it`, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried off what `it` yielded without a wheelbarrow —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know `it` for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded `it`, milked `it`, skimmed `it`, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: `its` complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; `its` bounding on the river, which the owner said protected `it` by `its` fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of `it` from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  I was in haste to buy `it`, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry `it` on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for `it` and be unmolested in my possession of `it`; for I knew all the while that `it` would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let `it` alone —— walden

-  But `it` turned out as I have said —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn `it` thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at `it`, and do not think `it` enough to go round `it` once —— walden

-  The oftener you go there the more `it` will please you, if `it` is good —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and round `it` as long as I live, and be buried in `it` first, that `it` may please me the more at last —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made `it` cool at night —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave `it` a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when `its` timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  To my imagination `it` retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear `it` —— walden

-  It was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines —— walden

-  I did not need to go outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of `its` freshness —— walden

-  `It` was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even in the rainiest weather —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than `it`, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond `it` impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, `its` bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw `it` throwing off `its` nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, `its` soft ripples or `its` smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above `it` being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven `itself` so much the more important —— walden

-  `It` is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth —— walden

-  One value even of the smallest well is, that when you look into `it` you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden

-  This is as important as that `it` keeps butter cool —— walden
