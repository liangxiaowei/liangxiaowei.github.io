- `moustache` [məˈstɑ:ʃ]



-  Wilson stroked his very young moustache and dreamed, waiting for his gin-and-bitters —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter
