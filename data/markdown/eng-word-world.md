- `world` S1 W1 [wɜ:rld]



-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the `world`, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the `world` on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  With this more substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling in the `world` —— walden
