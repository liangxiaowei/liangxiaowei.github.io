- `than` S1 W1 [ðən]



- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher `than` it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day `than` usual, as on the sides of mountains —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother `than` at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden
