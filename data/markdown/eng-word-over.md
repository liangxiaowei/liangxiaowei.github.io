- `over` S1 W1 [ˈoʊvə(r)]



-  I walked `over` each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  The winds which passed `over` my dwelling were such as sweep `over` the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music —— walden

-  That way I looked between and `over` the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue —— walden

-  But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see `over` or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden
