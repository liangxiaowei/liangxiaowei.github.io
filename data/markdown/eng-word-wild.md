- `wild` S2 W2 [waɪld]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his `wild` apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few `wild` apples only —— walden
