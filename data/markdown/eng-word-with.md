- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered `with` wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged `with` blue —— walden

-  The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses — a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love  —— the heart of the matter

-  If you would step with me for a moment into the bathroom  —— the heart of the matter
