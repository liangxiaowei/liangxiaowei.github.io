        The origin of the term "structured" was a paper called "Structured Design" by Glenford J. Myers,
        Wayne P. Stevens, and Larry Constantine, that appeared in the IBM Systems Journal in 1974. In
        1975, Glen Myers, one of Larry Constantine's students at IBM SRI, published Reliable Software
        Through Composite Design. Then in 1977 and 1978, almost simultaneously, several important
        books on the structured methods appeared – Structured Design by Ed Yourdon and Larry
        Constantine, Structured Analysis and System Specification Tom De Marco, Structured Systems
        Analysis by Chris Gane and Trish Sarson, and Structured Systems Development by Ken Orr.
        Perhaps the most influential of these books was Tom De Marco's Structured Analysis and System
        Specification, published through the Yourdon press.

    - 95% of the words [about software architecture] are spent extolling the benefits of “modularity” and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it.

    - [Norman Ramsey](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/) says:
    - Hurrah for you, Shamus! I hate seeing C++ used as an introduction.
    - As for the real stuff, I learned most of it in the library. Good textbooks will cover abstraction and separation of concerns, which are getting at the good stuff. I recommend How to Design Programs, free online at htdp.org, and also Liskov and Guttag’s out-of-print classed Abstraction and Specification in Program Development. (Don’t buy the new Java edition; the original is much better.)
    - Finally, some of the classics are, well, classic. I learned a lot from Glenford Myers’s book Composite/Structured Design. Constantine and Yourdon wrote a good book on design, too.
    - Finally, I suggest avoiding the classic “gang of four” book on design patterns. It is mostly ways of working around things in C++ that are broken. The rest is lengthy explications of how experienced programmers solve simple problems, with lots of shiny terminology. Good if you like that sort of thing, I guess.
    - One last thing: practice. For about 10,000 hours. But do remember that sometimes if you spend two weeks hacking you can save a whole afternoon that you would otherwise have had to spend in the library.
