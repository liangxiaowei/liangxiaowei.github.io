- `the` S1 W1 [ðə]



- At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as `the` possible site of a house —— walden

-  I have thus surveyed `the` country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live —— walden

-  In imagination I have bought all `the` farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  Wherever I sat, there I might live, and `the` landscape radiated from me accordingly —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from `the` village, but to my eyes `the` village was too far from it —— walden

-  Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let `the` years run off, buffet `the` winter through, and see `the` spring come in —— walden

-  The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their houses, may be sure that they have been anticipated —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out `the` land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before `the` door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to `the` best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to `the` number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had `the` refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought `the` Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before `the` owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak `the` truth, I had but ten cents in `the` world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep `the` ten dollars and `the` farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him `the` farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  But I retained `the` landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed `the` most valuable part of a farm, while `the` crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, `the` owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, `the` most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all `the` cream, and left `the` farmer only `the` skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of `the` Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from `the` village, half a mile from `the` nearest neighbor, and separated from `the` highway by a broad field; its bounding on `the` river, which `the` owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in `the` spring, though that was nothing to me; `the` gray color and ruinous state of `the` house and barn, and `the` dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and `the` last occupant; `the` hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, `the` recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up `the` river, when `the` house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard `the` house-dog bark —— walden

-  I was in haste to buy it, before `the` proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down `the` hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in `the` pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements —— walden

-  To enjoy `the`se advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take `the` world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all `the` while that it would yield `the` most abundant crop of `the` kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  I have no doubt that time discriminates between `the` good and `the` bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or `the` county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and `the` only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of `the` passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  The oftener you go there `the` more it will please you, if it is good —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me `the` more at last —— walden

- The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe more at length, for convenience putting `the` experience of two years into one —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in `the` morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in `the` woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or `the` Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against `the` rain, without plastering or chimney, `the` walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in `the` morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout `the` day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over `the` ridges of mountains, bearing `the` broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music —— walden

-  The morning wind forever blows, `the` poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are `the` ears that hear it —— walden

-  Olympus is but `the` outside of `the` earth everywhere —— walden

- The only house I had been `the` owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in `the` summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but `the` boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down `the` stream of time —— walden

-  With this more substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling in `the` world —— walden

-  This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of crystallization around me, and reacted on `the` builder —— walden

-  I did not need to go outdoors to take `the` air, for `the` atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness —— walden

-  It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even in `the` rainiest weather —— walden

-  The Harivansa says, “An abode without birds is like a meat without seasoning —— walden

- ” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor to `the` birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near `the`m —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent `the` garden and `the` orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of `the` forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, `the` veery, `the` scarlet tanager, `the` field sparrow, `the` whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by `the` shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of `the` village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in `the` midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in `the` woods that `the` opposite shore, half a mile off, like `the` rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For `the` first week, whenever I looked out on `the` pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on `the` side of a mountain, its bottom far above `the` surface of other lakes, and, as `the` sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while `the` mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into `the` woods, as at `the` breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  The very dew seemed to hang upon `the` trees later into `the` day than usual, as on `the` sides of mountains —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in `the` intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but `the` sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all `the` serenity of evening, and `the` wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and `the` clear portion of `the` air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, `the` water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much `the` more important —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where `the` wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across `the` pond, through a wide indentation in `the` hills which form `the` shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  That way I looked between and over `the` near green hills to some distant and higher ones in `the` horizon, tinged with blue —— walden

-  Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of `the` peaks of `the` still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in `the` northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of `the` village —— walden

-  But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond `the` woods which surrounded me —— walden

-  It is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float `the` earth —— walden

-  One value even of `the` smallest well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden

-  When I looked across `the` pond from this peak toward `the` Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all `the` earth beyond `the` pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden

-  WILSON SAT ON THE BALCONY OF THE BEDFORD Hotel with his bald pink knees thrust against the ironwork —— the heart of the matter

-  It was Sunday and the Cathedral bell clanged for matins —— the heart of the matter

-  On the other side of Bond Street, in the windows of the High School, sat the young Negresses in dark blue gym smocks engaged on the interminable task of trying to wave their wirespring hair —— the heart of the matter

-  Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea —— the heart of the matter

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter

-  He was like the lagging finger of the barometer, still pointing to Fair long after its companion had moved to Stormy —— the heart of the matter

-  Below him the black clerks moved churchward, but their wives in brilliant afternoon dresses of blue and cerise aroused no interest in Wilson —— the heart of the matter

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  On either side of the school the tin roofs sloped towards the sea, and the corrugated iron above his head clanged and clattered as a vulture alighted —— the heart of the matter

- Three merchant officers from the convoy in the harbour came into view, walking up from the quay —— the heart of the matter

-  The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme: "Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty girl schoolteacher, captain want jig jig —— the heart of the matter

- " The bearded Indian frowned over intricate calculations on the back of an envelope — a horoscope, the cost of living? When Wilson looked down into the street again the officers had fought their way free, and the schoolboys had swarmed again round a single able-seaman; they led him triumphantly away towards the brothel near the police station, as though to the nursery —— the heart of the matter

-  The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses — a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love  —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  "Excuse me," a voice said, "aren't you Wilson?1' He looked up at a middle-aged man in the inevitable khaki shorts with a drawn face the colour of hay —— the heart of the matter

-  "The leaders of society —— the heart of the matter

- " "Why the bathroom?" Wilson asked —— the heart of the matter

-  I suppose it's the only private room available —— the heart of the matter

- " "Going home soon?" Harris stared over the tin roofs towards the harbour —— the heart of the matter

-  He said, "The ships all go the wrong way —— the heart of the matter

- " He lowered his voice and said with venom over his lemon squash, "I hate the place —— the heart of the matter

-  I hate the bloody niggers —— the heart of the matter

- It's all right up in the Protectorate —— the heart of the matter

-  The Government's afraid of them —— the heart of the matter

-  The police are afraid of them —— the heart of the matter

- " A vulture flapped and shifted on the iron roof and Wilson looked at Scobie —— the heart of the matter

-  He looked without interest in obedience to a stranger's direction, and it seemed to him that no particular interest attached to the squat grey-haired man walking alone up Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  He couldn't tell that this was one of those occasions a man never forgets: a small cicatrice had been made on the memory, a wound that would ache whenever certain things combined — the taste of gin at midday, the smell of flowers under a balcony, the clang of corrugated iron, an ugly bird flopping from perch to perch —— the heart of the matter

- " "Is that the police uniform?" "It is —— the heart of the matter

-  A lost thing will they never find — you know the poem —— the heart of the matter

-  His eyes followed Scobie up the sun-drowned street —— the heart of the matter

-  "Probably in the pay of the Syrians too, if the truth were known —— the heart of the matter

- " "The Syrians?" "This is the original Tower of Babel," Harris said —— the heart of the matter

-  "West Indians, Africans, real Indians, Syrians, Englishmen, Scotsmen in the Office of Works —— the heart of the matter

- " "What do the Syrians do?" —— the heart of the matter

-  They run all the stores up-country and most of the stores here —— the heart of the matter

- " "The Germans pay a high price/' "Hasn't he got a wife here?0 "Who? Oh, Scobie —— the heart of the matter

-  She's the city intellectual —— the heart of the matter

-  Got up an exhibition of arts for the shipwrecked seamen —— the heart of the matter

-  You know the kind of thing — poems on exile by aircraftsmen, water-colours by stokers, poker-work from the mission schools —— the heart of the matter
