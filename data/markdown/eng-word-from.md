-  Wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radiated `from` me accordingly —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far `from` the village, but to my eyes the village was too far `from` it —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles `from` the village, half a mile `from` the nearest neighbor, and separated `from` the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs `from` frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it `from` my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude `from` them —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing `from` hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard `from` shore to shore —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins `from` heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden

-  But in other directions, even `from` this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond `from` this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter

- Three merchant officers from the convoy in the harbour came into view, walking up from the quay —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter
