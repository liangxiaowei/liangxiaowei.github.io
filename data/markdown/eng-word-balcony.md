- `balcony` [ˈbælkəni]

- WILSON SAT ON THE BALCONY OF THE BEDFORD Hotel with his bald pink knees thrust against the ironwork —— the heart of the matter

- He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

- He couldn't tell that this was one of those occasions a man never forgets: a small cicatrice had been made on the memory, a wound that would ache whenever certain things combined — the taste of gin at midday, the smell of flowers under a balcony, the clang of corrugated iron, an ugly bird flopping from perch to perch —— the heart of the matter
