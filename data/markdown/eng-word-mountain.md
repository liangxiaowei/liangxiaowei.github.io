-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a `mountain`, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of `mountains` —— walden
