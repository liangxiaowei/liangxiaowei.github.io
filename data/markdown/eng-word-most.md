- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the `most` valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the `most` admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the `most` abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my `most` distant horizon —— walden

- This small lake was of `most` value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  They run all the stores up-country and most of the stores here —— the heart of the matter
