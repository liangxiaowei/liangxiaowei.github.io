- `while` S1 W2 [hwaɪl, waɪl]



- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, `while` the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the `while` that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, `while` the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden
