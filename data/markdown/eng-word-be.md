- `be` S1 W1 [bi]



- At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house —— walden

-  In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to `be` bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  This experience entitled me to `be` regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to `be` soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their houses, may `be` sure that they have `be`en anticipated —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should `be` left to stand `be`fore the door, and whence each blasted tree could `be` seen to the `be`st advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had `be`gun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but `be`fore the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to `be` generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  I found thus that I had `be`en a rich man without any damage to my poverty —— walden

- “I am monarch of all I survey, —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, `be`ing, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval `be`tween me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed `be`hind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  I was in haste to buy it, `be`fore the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and `be` unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  I have no doubt that time discriminates `be`tween the good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall `be` less likely to `be` disappointed —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and round it as long as I live, and `be` buried in it first, that it may please me the more at last —— walden

- The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe more at length, for convenience putting the experience of two years into one —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, `be`gan to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls `be`ing of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments —— walden

-  The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains, `be`aring the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music —— walden

-  The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it —— walden

- The only house I had `be`en the owner of `be`fore, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

-  This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of crystallization around me, and reacted on the builder —— walden

-  It was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines —— walden

-  It was not so much within doors as `be`hind a door where I sat, even in the rainiest weather —— walden

- ” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood `be`tween that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water `be`ing perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it `be`ing shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, `be`comes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had `be`en recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth `be`yond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
