- `school` S1 W1 [skul]



-  On the other side of Bond Street, in the windows of the High School, sat the young Negresses in dark blue gym smocks engaged on the interminable task of trying to wave their wirespring hair —— the heart of the matter

-  On either side of the school the tin roofs sloped towards the sea, and the corrugated iron above his head clanged and clattered as a vulture alighted —— the heart of the matter

-  They were surrounded immediately by small boys wearing school caps —— the heart of the matter

-  You know the kind of thing — poems on exile by aircraftsmen, water-colours by stokers, poker-work from the mission schools —— the heart of the matter
