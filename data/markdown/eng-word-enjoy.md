- `enjoy` S1 W1 [ɛnˈdʒɔɪ]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had `enjoy`ed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having `enjoy`ed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  To `enjoy` these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden
