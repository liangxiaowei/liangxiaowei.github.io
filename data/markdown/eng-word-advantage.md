- `advantage` S2 W1 [ədˈvæntɪdʒ]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best `advantage`; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  To enjoy these `advantage`s I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden
