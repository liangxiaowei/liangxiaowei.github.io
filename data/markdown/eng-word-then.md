- `then` S1 W1 [ðɛn]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and `then` I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

- All that I could say, `then`, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden
