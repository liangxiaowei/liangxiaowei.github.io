- `round` W3 [raʊnd]



- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go `round` it once —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go `round` and `round` it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me the more at last —— walden
