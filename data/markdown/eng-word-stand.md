- `stand` S1 W1 [stænd]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to `stand` before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, `standing` on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

-  Indeed, by `standing` on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden
