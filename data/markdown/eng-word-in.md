- `In imagination` I have bought all the farms `in succession`, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price. —— walden

- I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him `in my mind`; —— walden

- Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring `come in`. —— walden

- Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents `in the world`, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together. —— walden

- Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm `in rhyme`, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk. —— walden
- its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts `in the spring`, though that was nothing to me; —— walden

- I was `in haste` to buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up `in the pasture`, or, `in short`, had made any more of his improvements. —— walden
- like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders—I never heard what compensation he received for that—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested `in my possession` of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone. —— walden
- When you think of getting a farm turn it thus `in your mind`, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once.  —— walden

- I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and round it as long as I live, and be `buried in it` first, that it may please me the more at last.  —— walden

- As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer `in the morning`, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up. —— walden

- When first I took up my abode `in the woods`, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night. —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions `in the summer`, and this is still rolled up `in my garret`; —— walden

- It was suggestive somewhat as a picture `in outlines`. —— walden

- It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even `in the rainiest weather`. —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, `in the midst` of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low `in the woods` that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon. —— walden

- For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing `in every direction` `in`to the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle. —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor `in the `in`tervals` of a gentle rainstorm `in August`, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore. —— walden

- From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide `in`dentation `in the hills` which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out `in that direction` through a wooded valley, but stream there was none. —— walden
- That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones `in the horizon`, tinged with blue. —— walden

- Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges `in the northwest`, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village. —— walden

- It is well to have some water `in your neighborhood`, to give buoyancy to and float the earth.  —— walden

- When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which `in time` of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage `in their seething valley`, like a coin `in a basin`, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust `in`sulated and floated even by this small sheet of `in`terverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land. —— walden


-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land `in`to orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich `in` proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts `in` the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested `in` my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus `in` your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially `in` the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions `in` the summer, and this is still rolled up `in` my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

-  With this more substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling `in` the world —— walden

-  But `in` other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden
