- `small` S1 W1 [smɔl]



-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those `smaller` and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a `small` pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

- This `small` lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  One value even of the `smallest` well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this `small` sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
