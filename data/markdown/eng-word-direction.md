- `direction` S1 W1 [dɪˈrɛkʃən,daɪ-]



-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every `direction` into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that `direction` through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  But in other `direction`s, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden
