- `well` S1 W2 [wɛl]



-  `Well`, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as `well` as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  It is `well` to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth —— walden

-  One value even of the smallest `well` is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden
