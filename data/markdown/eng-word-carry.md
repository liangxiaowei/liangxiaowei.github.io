- `carry` S1 W1 [ˈkæri]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to `carry` it on —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to `carry` it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to `carry` it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden
