- `wind` S3 W3 [wɪnd]



-  The `winds` which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music —— walden

-  The morning `wind` forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it —— walden
