- `distant` W3 [ˈdɪstənt]



- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most `distant` horizon —— walden

-  That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some `distant` and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue —— walden

-  Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more `distant` mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden
