- `want` S1 W1 [wɑ:nt]



- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I `wanted`﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I `wanted`, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden
