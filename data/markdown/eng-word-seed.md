- `seed` S3 W3 [sid]



-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my `seed`s, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and `seed`s, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my `seed`s ready —— walden

-  Many think that `seed`s improve with age —— walden
