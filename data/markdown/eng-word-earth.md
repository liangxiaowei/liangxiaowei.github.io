- `earth` S2 W2 [ɜ:rθ]



-  Olympus is but the outside of the `earth` everywhere —— walden

-  It is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the `earth` —— walden

-  One value even of the smallest well is, that when you look into it you see that `earth` is not continent but insular —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the `earth` beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
