- `water` S1 W1 [ˈwɔtɚ,ˈwɑtɚ]



- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and `water` being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the `water`, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden

-  It is well to have some `water` in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting `water`, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
