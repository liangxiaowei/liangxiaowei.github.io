- `where` S1 W1 [wer]



-  I have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of `where` I live —— walden

-  This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and `where` a goddess might trail her garments —— walden

-  It was not so much within doors as behind a door `where` I sat, even in the rainiest weather —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, `where` the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, `where` their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden
