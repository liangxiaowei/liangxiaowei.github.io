- At `a certain season` of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of `a house` —— walden

-  I have thus surveyed the country on every side within `a dozen miles` of where I live —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put `a higher price` on it—took everything but `a deed` of it—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  This experience entitled me to be regarded as `a sort of` real-estate broker by my friends —— walden

-  What is `a house` but `a sedes`, `a seat`?—better if `a country seat` —— walden

-  I discovered many `a site` for `a house` not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for `an hour, a summer and a winter life`; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in —— walden

-  `An afternoon` sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for `a man` is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to `make a wheelbarrow` to carry it on or off with; but before the owner `gave me a deed` of it, his wife—every man has `such a wife`—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had `a farm`, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not `a rich man`, made him `a present` of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for `a wheelbarrow` left —— walden

- I have frequently seen `a poet` withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of `a farm`, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got `a few wild apples` only —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, `half a mile` from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by `a broad field`; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such `an interval` between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind `a dense grove` of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on `a large scale`—I have always cultivated `a garden`—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write `an ode` to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely `a defence` against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it `a clean and airy look`, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of `a certain house` on `a mountain` which I had visited `a year` before —— walden

-  This was `an airy and unplastered cabin`, fit to entertain `a travelling god`, and where `a goddess` might trail her garments —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except `a boat`, was `a tent`, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

-  This frame, so slightly clad, was `a sort of` crystallization around me, and reacted on the builder —— walden

-  It was suggestive somewhat as `a picture` in outlines —— walden

-  It was not so much within doors as behind `a door` where I sat, even in the rainiest weather —— walden

-  The Harivansa says, “An abode without birds is like `a meat` without seasoning —— walden

-  I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade `a villager`—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of `a small pond`, about `a mile` and `a half south` of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of `an extensive wood` between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, `half a mile` off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like `a tarn` high up on the side of `a mountain`, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as `a neighbor` in the intervals of `a gentle rainstorm` in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  `A lake` like this is never smoother than at `such a time`; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes `a lower heaven` itself so much the more important —— walden

-  From `a hilltop` near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was `a pleasing vista` southward across the pond, through `a wide indentation` in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested `a stream` flowing out in that direction through `a wooded valley`, but stream there was none —— walden

-  Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch `a glimpse` of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by `a mirage` in their seething valley, like `a coin` in `a basin`, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like `a thin crust` insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden




- At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house —— walden

-  I have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  This experience entitled me to be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends —— walden

-  What is a house but a sedes, a seat?﻿—better if a country seat —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty —— walden

-  But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  On either side of the school the tin roofs sloped towards the sea, and the corrugated iron above his head clanged and clattered as a vulture alighted —— the heart of the matter

-  The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme: "Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty girl schoolteacher, captain want jig jig —— the heart of the matter

- " The bearded Indian frowned over intricate calculations on the back of an envelope — a horoscope, the cost of living? When Wilson looked down into the street again the officers had fought their way free, and the schoolboys had swarmed again round a single able-seaman; they led him triumphantly away towards the brothel near the police station, as though to the nursery —— the heart of the matter

-  A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel — or a poem —— the heart of the matter

-  Wilson liked poetry, but he absorbed it secretly like a drug —— the heart of the matter

-  The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses — a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love  —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  "Excuse me," a voice said, "aren't you Wilson?1' He looked up at a middle-aged man in the inevitable khaki shorts with a drawn face the colour of hay —— the heart of the matter

- A —— the heart of the matter
