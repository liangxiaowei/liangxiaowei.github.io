- `man` S1 W1 [mæn]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a `man` is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every `man` has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that `man` who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich `man`, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  I found thus that I had been a rich `man` without any damage to my poverty —— walden

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  "Excuse me," a voice said, "aren't you Wilson?1' He looked up at a middle-aged man in the inevitable khaki shorts with a drawn face the colour of hay —— the heart of the matter
