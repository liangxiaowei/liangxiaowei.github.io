- `far` S1 W1 [fɑr]



-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too `far` from the village, but to my eyes the village was too `far` from it —— walden

- My imagination carried me so `far` that I even had the refusal of several `far`ms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the `far`m too, for I had carried it `far` enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the `far`m for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom `far` above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden
