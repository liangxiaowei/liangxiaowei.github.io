- At a certain season of our life we are accustomed `to` consider every spot as the possible site of a house —— walden

-  In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were `to` be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it `to` him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love `to` talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too `to` some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him `to` carry it on —— walden

-  This experience entitled me `to` be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely `to` be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but `to` my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed `to` lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and `to` decide what fine oaks or pines should be left `to` stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen `to` the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion `to` the number of things which he can afford `to` let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came `to` actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun `to` sort my seeds, and collected materials with which `to` make a wheelbarrow `to` carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished `to` keep it, and he offered me ten dollars `to` release him —— walden

-  Now, `to` speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic `to` tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all `to`gether —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, `to` be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage `to` my poverty —— walden

-  With respect `to` landscapes, —— walden

- My right there is none `to` dispute —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, `to` me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing `to` me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  I was in haste `to` buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready `to` carry it on; like Atlas, `to` take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford `to` let it alone —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect `to` farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  I have no doubt that time discriminates between the good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely `to` be disappointed —— walden

-  But I would say `to` my fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and uncommitted —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed `to` a farm or the county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not `to` buy greedily; nor spare your pains `to` look at it, and do not think it enough `to` go round it once —— walden

- The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose `to` describe more at length, for convenience putting the experience of two years into one —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose `to` write an ode `to` dejection, but `to` brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only `to` wake my neighbors up —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began `to` spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  `To` my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit `to` entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand `to` hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

-  I did not need `to` go outdoors `to` take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness —— walden

- ” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor `to` the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them —— walden

-  I was not only nearer `to` some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but `to` those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager﻿—the wood thrush, the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that `to`wn and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known `to` fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  The very dew seemed `to` hang upon the trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of mountains —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore `to` shore —— walden

-  That way I looked between and over the near green hills `to` some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue —— walden

-  It is well `to` have some water in your neighborhood, `to` give buoyancy `to` and float the earth —— walden

-  On the other side of Bond Street, in the windows of the High School, sat the young Negresses in dark blue gym smocks engaged on the interminable task of trying to wave their wirespring hair —— the heart of the matter

-  Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea —— the heart of the matter

-  He was like the lagging finger of the barometer, still pointing to Fair long after its companion had moved to Stormy —— the heart of the matter

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme: "Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty girl schoolteacher, captain want jig jig —— the heart of the matter

- " The bearded Indian frowned over intricate calculations on the back of an envelope — a horoscope, the cost of living? When Wilson looked down into the street again the officers had fought their way free, and the schoolboys had swarmed again round a single able-seaman; they led him triumphantly away towards the brothel near the police station, as though to the nursery —— the heart of the matter

-  A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel — or a poem —— the heart of the matter

-  The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses — a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love  —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  Perhaps he would like to read my letters of recommendation  —— the heart of the matter
