- `wide` S3 W3 [waɪd]



- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with `wide` chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a `wide` indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden
