- `even` S1 W1 [ˈivən]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; `even` put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I `even` had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, `even` in the rainiest weather —— walden

-  But in other directions, `even` from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden

-  One value `even` of the smallest well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated `even` by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
