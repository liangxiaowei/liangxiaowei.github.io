- `imagination` S3 W3 [ɪˌmædʒəˈneʃən]



-  In `imagination` I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

- My `imagination` carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  To my `imagination` it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden
