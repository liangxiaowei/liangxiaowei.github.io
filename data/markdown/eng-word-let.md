- `let` S1 W1 [lɛt]



-  Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could `let` the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I `let` it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to `let` alone —— walden

-  However, I `let` him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to `let` it alone —— walden
