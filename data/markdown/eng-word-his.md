- `his` S1 W1 [hɪz]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted `his` wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took `his` farm at `his` price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took `his` word for `his` deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, `his` wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put `his` farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

-  I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of `his` improvements —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on `his` roost, if only to wake my neighbors up —— walden

-  WILSON SAT ON THE BALCONY OF THE BEDFORD Hotel with his bald pink knees thrust against the ironwork —— the heart of the matter

-  Wilson stroked his very young moustache and dreamed, waiting for his gin-and-bitters —— the heart of the matter

-  Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea —— the heart of the matter

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  On either side of the school the tin roofs sloped towards the sea, and the corrugated iron above his head clanged and clattered as a vulture alighted —— the heart of the matter

-  A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel — or a poem —— the heart of the matter

-  His taste was romantic —— the heart of the matter

-  For public exhibition he had his Wallace —— the heart of the matter

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

- " The Indian rose from his table and approached with deference —— the heart of the matter

- " The grubby sheaf of envelopes was always in his hand —— the heart of the matter

- " He lowered his voice and said with venom over his lemon squash, "I hate the place —— the heart of the matter
