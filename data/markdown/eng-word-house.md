- At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a `house` —— walden

-  What is a `house` but a sedes, a seat?—better if a country seat —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a `house` not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their `houses`, may be sure that they have been anticipated —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the `house` and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the `house` was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the `house-dog` bark —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my `house` was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain `house` on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

- The only `house` I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden
