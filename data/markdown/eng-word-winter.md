- `winter` S2 W2 [ˈwɪntɚ]



-  Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a `winter` life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the `winter` through, and see the spring come in —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for `winter`, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden
