- `go` S1 W1 [goʊ]



- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to `go` round it once —— walden

-  The oftener you `go` there the more it will please you, if it is good —— walden

- ” I think I shall not buy greedily, but `go` round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me the more at last —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has `gone` down the stream of time —— walden

-  I did not need to `go` outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness —— walden
