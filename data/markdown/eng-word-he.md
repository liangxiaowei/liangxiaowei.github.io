- `he` S1 W1 [hi]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which `he` can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed `he`r mind and wished to keep it, and `he` offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as `he` was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that `he` had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never `he`ard what compensation `he` received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden
