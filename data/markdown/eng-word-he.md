-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which `he` can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and `he` offered me ten dollars to release `him` —— walden

-  However, I let `him` keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold `him` the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as `he` was not a rich man, made `him` a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that `he` had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation `he` received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden


-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with `him`, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to `him` in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and `him` too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving `him` to carry it on —— walden

-  Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea —— the heart of the matter

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter

-  He was like the lagging finger of the barometer, still pointing to Fair long after its companion had moved to Stormy —— the heart of the matter

-  Below him the black clerks moved churchward, but their wives in brilliant afternoon dresses of blue and cerise aroused no interest in Wilson —— the heart of the matter

-  He was alone on the balcony except for one bearded Indian in a turban who had already tried to tell his fortune: this was not the hour or the day for white men — they would be at the beach five miles away, but Wilson had no car —— the heart of the matter

-  He felt almost intolerably lonely —— the heart of the matter
