-  Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I `could` let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in —— walden

-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and whence each blasted tree `could` be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I `could` only afford to let it alone —— walden

- All that I `could` say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I `could` catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the village —— walden

-  But in other directions, even from this point, I `could` not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me —— walden
