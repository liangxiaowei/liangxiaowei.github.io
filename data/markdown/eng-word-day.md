- `day` S1 W1 [de]



- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as `day`s there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  To my imagination it retained throughout the `day` more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the `day` than usual, as on the sides of mountains —— walden
