- `farmer` S2 W2 [ˈfɑ:rmə(r)]



-  I walked over each `farmer’s` premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty `farmer` supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the `farmer` only the skimmed milk —— walden
