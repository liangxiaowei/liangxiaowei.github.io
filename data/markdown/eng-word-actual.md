- `actual` S1 W2 [ˈæktʃuəl]



- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by `actual possession` —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to `actual possession` was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden
