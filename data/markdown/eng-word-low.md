- `low` S1 W1 [loʊ]



- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so `low` in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a `low`er heaven itself so much the more important —— walden
