- `plaster` [ˈplɑ:stə(r)]



- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments —— walden
