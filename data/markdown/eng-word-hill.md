- `hill` S2 W2 [hɪl]



-  From a `hilltop` near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the `hills` which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  That way I looked between and over the near green `hills` to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue —— walden
