- `material` W3 [məˈtɪriəl]



-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected `material`s with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and `material`s for a wheelbarrow left —— walden
