- `gin` [dʒɪn]



-  A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel — or a poem —— the heart of the matter

-  He couldn't tell that this was one of those occasions a man never forgets: a small cicatrice had been made on the memory, a wound that would ache whenever certain things combined — the taste of gin at midday, the smell of flowers under a balcony, the clang of corrugated iron, an ugly bird flopping from perch to perch —— the heart of the matter

-  Have another gin?" "I think I will," said Wilson —— the heart of the matter
