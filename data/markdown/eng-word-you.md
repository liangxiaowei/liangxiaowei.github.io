- `you` S1 W1 [ju:]



-  It makes but little difference whether `you` are committed to a farm or the county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When `you` think of getting a farm turn it thus in `your` mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare `your` pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  The oftener `you` go there the more it will please `you`, if it is good —— walden

-  One value even of the smallest well is, that when `you` look into it `you` see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden
