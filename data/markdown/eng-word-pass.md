- `pass` S2 W3 [pæs]

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after `pass`ing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden
