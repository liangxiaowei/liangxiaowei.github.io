- `door` S1 W1 [dɔr,dor]



-  An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the `door`, and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it lie, fallow, perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed `door` and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  It was not so much within `doors` as behind a `door` where I sat, even in the rainiest weather —— walden
