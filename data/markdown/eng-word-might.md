- `might` S1 W1 [maɪt]



-  Wherever I sat, there I `might` live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some `might` have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

-  Well, there I `might` live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I `might` pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

-  This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess `might` trail her garments —— walden
