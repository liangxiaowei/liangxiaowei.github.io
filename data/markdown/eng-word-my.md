- `my` S1 W1 [maɪ]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in `my` mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  This experience entitled me to be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by `my` friends —— walden

-  I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought too far from the village, but to `my` eyes the village was too far from it —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got `my` fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort `my` seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed `my` arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had `my` ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

-  I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage to `my` poverty —— walden

- My right there is none to dispute —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from `my` earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on `my` shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in `my` possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had `my` seeds ready —— walden

-  But I would say to `my` fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and uncommitted —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is `my` Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

- The present was `my` next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe more at length, for convenience putting the experience of two years into one —— walden

-  As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake `my` neighbors up —— walden

- When first I took up `my` abode in the woods, that is, began to spend `my` nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, `my` house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  To `my` imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before —— walden

-  The winds which passed over `my` dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial music —— walden

- The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is still rolled up in `my` garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time —— walden

- ” Such was not `my` abode, for I found `my`self suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged `my`self near them —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was `my` most distant horizon —— walden

-  The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme: "Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty girl schoolteacher, captain want jig jig —— the heart of the matter

- " "May I join you? My name's Harris —— the heart of the matter

-  Harris, of my talents —— the heart of the matter

-  Perhaps he would like to read my letters of recommendation  —— the heart of the matter

-  "How did you know my name?" Wilson asked —— the heart of the matter

- "My boy seems all right —— the heart of the matter

-  Clerks in the stores, city council,magistrates, lawyers — my God —— the heart of the matter

-  But these — my God —— the heart of the matter
