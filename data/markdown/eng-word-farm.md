- `farm` S2 W2 [fɑ:rm]



-  In imagination I have bought all the `farm`s in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  I walked over each `farm`er’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his `farm` at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several `farm`s﻿—the refusal was all I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a `farm`, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the `farm` too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the `farm` for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a `farm`, while the crusty `farm`er supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his `farm` in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the `farm`er only the skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell `farm`, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to `farm`ing on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

-  It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a `farm` or the county jail —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a `farm` turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden
