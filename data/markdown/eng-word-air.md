- `air` S1 W1 [er]



-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it `a clean and airy look`, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  This was `an airy and unplastered cabin`, fit to entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments —— walden

-  I did not need to go outdoors to `take the air`, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, `both air and water being perfectly still`, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and `the clear portion of the air` above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden
