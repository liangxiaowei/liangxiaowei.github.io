- `look` S1 W1 [lʊk]



- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to `look` at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

-  The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy `look`, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I `look`ed out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  That way I `look`ed between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue —— walden

-  One value even of the smallest well is, that when you `look` into it you see that earth is not continent but insular —— walden

-  When I `look`ed across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
