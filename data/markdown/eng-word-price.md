- `price` S1 W1 [praɪs]



-  In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their `price` —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his `price`, at any `price`, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher `price` on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden
