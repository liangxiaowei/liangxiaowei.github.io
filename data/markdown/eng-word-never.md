-  But when I do get home you'll never see me here again —— the heart of the matter

-  He couldn't tell that this was one of those occasions a man never forgets: a small cicatrice had been made on the memory, a wound that would ache whenever certain things combined — the taste of gin at midday, the smell of flowers under a balcony, the clang of corrugated iron, an ugly bird flopping from perch to perch —— the heart of the matter

-  A lost thing will they never find — you know the poem —— the heart of the matter
