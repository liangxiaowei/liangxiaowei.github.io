- `take` S1 W1 [tek]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, `took` his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it—`took` everything but a deed of it—`took` his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to `take` the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- When first I `took` up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night —— walden

-  I did not need to go outdoors to `take` the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness —— walden

-  The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses — a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love  —— the heart of the matter
