-  In imagination I have bought `all` the farms in succession, for `all` were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

- My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms﻿—the refusal was `all` I wanted﻿—but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession —— walden

-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or `all` together —— walden

- “I am monarch of `all` I survey, —— walden

-  Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and got `all` the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk —— walden

- The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its complete retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above `all`, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark —— walden

-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do `all` those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew `all` the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale﻿—I have always cultivated a garden﻿—was, that I had had my seeds ready —— walden

- This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had `all` the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, `all` the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden
