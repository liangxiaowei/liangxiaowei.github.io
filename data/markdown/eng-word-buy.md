- `buy` S1 W1 [baɪ]



-  In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price —— walden

-  The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife﻿—every man has such a wife﻿—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him —— walden

-  I was in haste to `buy` it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says﻿—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage﻿—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to `buy` greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

- ” I think I shall not `buy` greedily, but go round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me the more at last —— walden
