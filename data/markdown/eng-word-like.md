-  To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; `like` Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders﻿—I never heard what compensation he received for that﻿—and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone —— walden

- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, `like` the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, `like` a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared `like` a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land —— walden

-  He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie — it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him — brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street —— the heart of the matter

-  Perhaps he would like to read my letters of recommendation  —— the heart of the matter
