- `any` S2 [ˈɛni]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at `any` price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  I found thus that I had been a rich man without `any` damage to my poverty —— walden

-  I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made `any` more of his improvements —— walden
