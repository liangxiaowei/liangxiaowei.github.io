- `withdraw` S3 W2 [wɪðˈdrɔ, wɪθ-]



-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it﻿—took everything but a deed of it﻿—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk﻿—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and `withdrew` when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

- I have frequently seen a poet `withdraw`, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily `withdraw`ing in every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden
