- `At a certain season` of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house —— walden

-  I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm `at his price`, `at any price`, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it—took everything but a deed of it—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk—cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on —— walden

-  I have no doubt that time discriminates between the good and the bad; and when `at last` I shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed —— walden

- Old Cato, whose De Re Rustica is my Cultivator , says—and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage—“When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to `look `at`` it, and do not think it enough to go round it once —— walden

- The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe more `at length`, for convenience putting the experience of two years into one —— walden

- When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool `at night` —— walden

-  For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as `at the breaking up` of some nocturnal conventicle —— walden

-  A lake like this is never smoother than `at such a time`; and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important —— walden
