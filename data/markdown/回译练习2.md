- Three merchant officers from the convoy in the harbour came into view, walking up from the quay.
- They were surrounded immediately by small boys wearing school caps.
- The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme:" Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty schoolteacher, Captain want jig jig."
- The bearded Indian frowned over intricate caculations on the back of the envelope —— a horoscope, the cost of living? When Wilson looked down into the street again the officers had fought their way free, and the schoolboys swarmed again round a single able-seaman;they led him triumphantly away towards the brothel near the police station, as though to the nursery.
- A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel —— or a poem.
- Wilson liked poetry, but he absorbed it secertly like a drug.
- The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses —— a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love..
- His taste was romantic.
- For public exhibition he had his Wallace.
- He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie —— it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him —— brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street.

- “Excuse me," a voice said, " aren't you Wilson?"
- He looked up at a middle-aged man in the inevitable khaki shorts with a drawn face the colour of hay."
- "Yes, that's me."
- "May I join you? My name's Harris."
- "Delighted, Mr. Harris."
- "You are the new accountant of U.A.C.? "
- "That's me. Have a drink?"
- "I'll have a lemon squash if you don't mind. Can't drink in the middle of the day."
- The Indian rose from his table and approached with deference."You remember me, Mr. Harris. Perhaps you would tell your friend, Mr. Harris, of my talents. Perhaps he would like to read my letters of recommendation..." The grubby sheaf of envelopes was always in his hand. "The leaders of society." 
- "Go off. Beat it, you old scoundrel, " Harris said.
- "How did you know my name?" Wilson asked.
- "Saw it on a cable. I'm a cable censor," Harris said. "What a job.What a place."
- "I can see from here, Mr. Harris. that your fortune has changed considerably. If you would step with me for a moment into the bathroom."
- "Beat it, Guanga Din"
- "Why the bathroom?" Wilson asked.
- "He always tells fortunes there. I suppose It's the only private room availabe.I never thought of asking why."
- "Been here long?"
- "Eighteen bloody months."
- "Going home soon?" Harris stared over the tin roofs towards the harbour. He said, "The ships all go the wrong way. But when I do get home you'll never see me here again."
- He lowered his voice and said with venom over his lemon squash,"I hate the place. I hate the people. I hate the bloody niggers. Mustn't call them that, you konw."
