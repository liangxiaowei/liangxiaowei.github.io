- Three merchant officers from the convoy in the harbour came into view, walking up from the quay.
- They were surrounded immediately by small boys wearing school caps.
- The boys' refrain came faintly up to Wilson like a nursery rhyme:" Captain want jig jig, my sister pretty schoolteacher, Captain want jig jig."
- The bearded Indian frowned over intricate caculations on the back of the envelope —— a horoscope, the cost of living? When Wilson looked down into the street again the officers had fought their way free, and the schoolboys swarmed again round a single able-seaman;they led him triumphantly away towards the brothel near the police station, as though to the nursery.
- A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel —— or a poem.
- Wilson liked poetry, but he absorbed it secertly like a drug.
- The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses —— a finger of Longfellow, Macauiay, Mangan: Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love..
- His taste was romantic.
- For public exhibition he had his Wallace.
- He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie —— it was his highest common factor: but his eyes betrayed him —— brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street.
