- `opposite` S2 W2 [ˈɑ:pəzət]



- I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the `opposite` shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon —— walden

-  From a hilltop near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their `opposite` sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none —— walden

-  His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite —— the heart of the matter
