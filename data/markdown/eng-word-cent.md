- `cent` S1 W1 [sent]



-  Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten `cents` in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten `cents`, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together —— walden

-  However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten `cents`, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left —— walden
